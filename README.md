# cacophony
Recently stumbled upon an old hdd with some songs I wrote for a punk around 2000-2004... 135 .mid-files to  be exact.

No mixing what so ever. 
Instrument levels like loud drums in some places if I'm not mistaken.

Notes:
00Face: after 02:00 it's just random shit that does not belong, just unused ideas if I remember correctly.

quick, before the hyenas come!
