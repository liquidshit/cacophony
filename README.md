# cacophony
Recently stumbled upon an old hdd with some songs I wrote for a punk rock band back in 2000-2004... 135 .mid-files to  be exact.

No mixing what so ever. 
Messed up instrument levels like loud drums and highhats that sound like sandpaper in some places if I'm not mistaken.

00Face.wav: after 02:00 it's just random shit that does not belong, just unused potentialideas if I remember correctly.

quick, before the hyenas come!
